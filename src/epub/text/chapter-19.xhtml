			<p>As soon as she could next morning she rang Townsend up at his office.</p>
			<p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>
			<p>“I want to see you.”</p>
			<p>“My dear, I’m awfully busy. I’m a working man.”</p>
			<p>“It’s very important. Can I come down to the office?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”</p>
			<p>“Well, come here then.”</p>
			<p>“I can’t possibly get away. What about this afternoon? And don’t you think it would be better if I didn’t come to your house?”</p>
			<p>“I must see you at once.”</p>
			<p>There was a pause and she was afraid that she had been cut off.</p>
			<p>“Are you there?” she asked anxiously.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I was thinking. Has anything happened?”</p>
			<p>“I can’t tell you over the telephone.”</p>
			<p>There was another silence before he spoke again.</p>
			<p>“Well, look here, I can manage to see you for ten minutes at one if that’ll do. You’d better go to Ku-Chou’s and I’ll come along as soon as I can.”</p>
			<p>“The curio shop?” she asked in dismay.</p>
			<p>“Well, we can’t meet in the lounge at the Tching Yen Hotel very well,” he answered.</p>
			<p>She noticed a trace of irritation in his voice.</p>
			<p>“Very well. I’ll go to Ku-Chou’s.”</p>
